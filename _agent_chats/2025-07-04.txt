JS node project that will loop through each directory like here "C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\AutoStepper-Java-v1.7" (argument) and copy the .sm file to a .bak file

Create a new class to process the .sm file after creating the .bak file
It will only modify things in the following section 

     dance-single:
     :
     Beginner:
     2:

and not touch other sections, like

//---------------dance-single - ----------------
#NOTES:
     dance-single:
     :
     Easy:
     4:

It need to identify that section and print out the content of that section using a utility function

I need it to extract the content between  Beginner: 2: and the next level and print it out

After extracting the beginner section, go through the section content and start processing:

0000
0010
1000
0000
,
1001
1000
0001
1000
,
0001
1000
0100
0000
,
0010
0000
1000
0001
,
0010
0100
0001
0000

every other line, make it 0000

Replace the processed beginner content in the original sm file

I want extract to be separate from replace - not part of each other, otherwise, the function doesn't do just one job

Fix it to not replace every other line, but go through it, 
Keep track of previous line
We are on current line.
If line has a 3, don't replace it
Only if previous line is not 0000 and conditions satisfy, then we replace this line with 0000
