JS node project that will loop through each directory like here "C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\AutoStepper-Java-v1.7" (argument) and copy the .sm file to a .bak file

Create a new class to process the .sm file after creating the .bak file
It will only modify things in the following section 

     dance-single:
     :
     Beginner:
     2:

and not touch other sections, like

//---------------dance-single - ----------------
#NOTES:
     dance-single:
     :
     Easy:
     4:

It need to identify that section and print out the content of that section using a utility function

I need it to extract the content between  Beginner: 2: and the next level and print it out

After extracting the beginner section, go through the section content and start processing:

0000
0010
1000
0000
,
1001
1000
0001
1000
,
0001
1000
0100
0000
,
0010
0000
1000
0001
,
0010
0100
0001
0000

every other line, make it 0000

Replace the processed beginner content in the original sm file

I want extract to be separate from replace - not part of each other, otherwise, the function doesn't do just one job

Fix it to not replace every other line, but go through it, 
Keep track of previous line
We are on current line.
If line has a 3, don't replace it
Only if previous line is not 0000 and conditions satisfy, then we replace this line with 0000

C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\autostepper-test\CẮT ĐÔI NỖI SẦU.mp3_dir\CẮT ĐÔI NỖI SẦU.mp3.sm

Instead of replace the section, make the processed section into 
     Beginner:
     1:

instead of 

     Beginner:
     2:

and insert the section between after the #ATTACKS:;

instead of replacing, based on a variable value, default to replace=false


Please create test based on C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\autostepper-mod\tests\CẮT ĐÔI NỖI SẦU.mp3.bak

Test insert:
1. Copy .bak to .sm
2. Process with insert
3. Content should match C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\autostepper-mod\tests\CẮT ĐÔI NỖI SẦU.mp3.inserted

Test replace:
1. Copy .bak to .sm
2. Process with replace
3. Content should match C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\autostepper-mod\tests\CẮT ĐÔI NỖI SẦU.mp3.replaced

Parameterize the test to replace param and expectedFile param so that it reduces test code duplication

Fix so that the tests pass. Keep the logic and comments in existing smProcessor.js so that the replace is every other line, unless the previous line is 0000 or this line contains 3. Look in the text file for existing context.


Fix smProcessor so that

it doesn't have this in the constructor
constructor(replace = false)

but in processAndHandleBeginnerContent, which will take in 
1. filePath
2. section to extract as "Beginner:2"
3. action can be "Insert before" or "Insert After"
4. newSectionName "Novice:1", or "Beginner:3" etc. first is the level, then the step level
