JS node project that will loop through each directory like here "C:\Users\mysti\Desktop\Repositories\AutoStepper-Java-v1.7" (argument) and copy the .sm file to a .bak file

Create a new class to process the .sm file after creating the .bak file
It will only modify things in the following section 

     dance-single:
     :
     Beginner:
     2:

and not touch other sections, like

//---------------dance-single - ----------------
#NOTES:
     dance-single:
     :
     Easy:
     4:

It need to identify that section and print out the content of that section using a utility function

I need it to extract the content between  Beginner: 2: and the next level and print it out

After extracting the beginner section, go through the section content and start processing:

0000
0010
1000
0000
,
1001
1000
0001
1000
,
0001
1000
0100
0000
,
0010
0000
1000
0001
,
0010
0100
0001
0000

every other line, make it 0000

Replace the processed beginner content in the original sm file

I want extract to be separate from replace - not part of each other, otherwise, the function doesn't do just one job
